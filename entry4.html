      <h2>Safety First!</h2>
      <p1>1. Always remember
        to stay with your friends and not let anyone go home alone. Check everyone made it back safe! </p1>
      <p2> 2.Cover your drink. Have your frend watch your cup, there are also fun gadgets to help you. <a

          gadget!</a></p2>
      <p3>3. Be aware of your surroundings. Stay in well lit places with other people. Don't go into an empty subway
        cart
        if you can help it.
        Pro tip- the middle carts usually have an mta worker in the booth :D</p3>

      <h2>Where to go?</h2>
      <p1>1.Concerts, they are a classic fun night time activity! Places like Radio City Music Hall, Webster Hall, and
        Pier 5 are just a couple fun places.
        <p2>2.Dinner spots, they're are all over the place. Lower East Side of Manhattan has plenty of cool places on
          St.
          Marks street. Prospect Park in Brooklyn is the best for a cute pasta spot.</p2>
        <p3>3. Dancing, do it anywhere! But if you want places with music, Delancy Roof top, Cafe Wa,and Paradise Club,
          they
          also have some lovely enteriors. Jazz clubs like Blue Note, Birdland Jazz club,and Winnie's Jazz Bar will
          seranade you in style. </p3>
