            <h2> NJ Transit to Q Line </h2>
            <p>Before I moved to Brooklyn I was commuting from central Jersey. For a 9 am class I would wake up at
                promptly at 6 am. This gave
                me one hour to get dressed, make breakfast, and pack a lunch. At around 7:00 I was out the door to make
                my train at 7:06. My dad
                drove me to our towns station. After he dropped me off I rushed to the tracks and hopped on. Once
                settled the conductor came to scan tickets
                Some mornings I needed to take a trasfer Train. That was today and as I waited in the cold at my
                transfer station thirty minutes rolled by.
                An announcement alerted the few commuters on the track that there would be no train and to wait for the
                next Hoboken bound.
                As I sit on a bench knowing I would be late, the next train rolls by. In confusion I assumed this was
                different train that was on schedule.
                Not mine. As the conductor closes the doors I realize it is my train. Which I had missed and I was to
                wait for the next one.
                Finally I get on my transfer train and reach my destination. At hoboken I rush towards the path trains
                for mahattan. There is yet a fifteen minute waite
                and I sit down. Once the path arrives I board and reach 14th street. I take a brisk walk to class two
                blocks away.
            </p>
            <p>After my move to Brooklyn I wake up 7 am for class. I take an hour to get ready then walk to my station a
                few blocks away.
                My Manhattan bound Q train arrives in the following seven minutes and board. The commute takes me to a
                sunrise view over the bridge
                and a stop motion show at barklay center. After thirty-five minutes I arrive at Union Square. From there
                I take a swift walk to
                class two blocks away.
